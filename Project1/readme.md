### KMeans Clustering Mall Customers Project

**Overview**  
This Jupyter Notebook, `KMeans_Clustering_Mall.ipynb`, explores customer segmentation using KMeans clustering on a dataset of mall customers. The project aims to identify distinct customer groups based on factors such as age, income, and spending score, providing insights into consumer behavior.

**Dataset**  
The dataset used for this project is `Mall_Customers.csv`, which includes the following features:

- **CustomerID**: A unique identifier for each customer.
- **Gender**: The gender of the customer (Male/Female).
- **Age**: The customer's age in years.
- **Annual Income (k$)**: The annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars.
- **Spending Score (1-100)**: A score assigned to the customer based on their spending behavior and purchasing frequency (1 = least, 100 = most).
- **Age_group**: The age category of the customer, with labels such as 55+ for customers above 55 years old.

Here is a sample of the dataset:

| CustomerID | Gender | Age | Annual Income (k$) | Spending Score (1-100) | Age_group |
|------------|--------|-----|--------------------|------------------------|-----------|
| 8          | Male   | 64  | 19                 | 3                      | 55+       |
| 10         | Male   | 67  | 19                 | 14                     | 55+       |
| 12         | Female | 58  | 20                 | 15                     | 55+       |
| 30         | Male   | 60  | 30                 | 4                      | 55+       |
| 40         | Female | 65  | 38                 | 35                     | 55+       |
