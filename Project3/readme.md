# Sentiment Analysis on Product Reviews

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook, `SentimentAnalysisonProductReviews.ipynb`, focuses on applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify customer product reviews by sentiment. The project aims to categorize reviews as positive, negative, or neutral, providing valuable insights into customer satisfaction and product perception.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle, containing millions of Amazon product reviews with the following features:

- `class`: Sentiment label (e.g., 2 = positive, 1 = negative)
- `title`: The title of the review
- `description`: Detailed customer feedback

### Sample Data
| class | title                           | description                                                                 |
